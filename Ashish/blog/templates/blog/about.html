        <p class="col-md-8 fs-4"> Blogger.com was founded in April 2022, after a very successful Kickstarter campaign to create a new platform focused solely on professional publishing and blogging. Our mission is to create the best open source tools for independent journalists and writers across the world, and have a real impact on the future of online media by the means of blogging.<br><br>

Today Blogger.com powers an incredible range of websites; from individual bloggers who are just getting started, to large teams of writers and editors at some of the largest organisations in the world. We've built a sustainable business around a free core application, funded by a premium platform as a service to run it on.</p>
